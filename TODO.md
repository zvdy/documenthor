  - [ ] Configure super GitHub PAT with org access
  - [ ] Implement secure key rotation strategy

## Phase 2: API Development üöÄ
- [ ] **Batch Processing API**
  - [ ] `/api/process-batch` endpoint
  - [ ] Repository list validation
  - [ ] Async job processing with status tracking
  - [ ] Webhook notifications for completion

- [ ] **GitHub Integration**
  - [ ] Organization repository discovery
  - [ ] Repository cloning with PAT
  - [ ] Automated commit and/or PR creation

## Phase 3: Infrastructure & Scaling üèóÔ∏è
- [ ] **Kubernetes Enhancement**

  - [ ] Custom AI prompts and formatting

## Phase 5: Observability & Maintenance üìä
- [ ] **Monitoring Dashboard**
  - [ ] Real-time processing status
  - [ ] GPU utilization metrics
  - [ ] Error tracking and alerting
  - [ ] Performance analytics

- [ ] **Operational Excellence**
  - [ ] Automated backup and recovery
  - [ ] Health checks and self-healing
  - [ ] Cost optimization and resource management
  - [ ] Security scanning and compliance

## Technical Specifications

### Authentication Flow
```
1. GitHub Action loads private key from secrets
2. Generates JWT with org/repo claims (RS256)
3. Sends batch request with JWT to ingress
4. Ingress fetches public key from JWK endpoint
5. Verifies JWT signature and claims
6. Forwards authenticated request to Documenthor
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/process-batch` - Process multiple repositories
- `GET /api/job/{id}/status` - Check processing status
- `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` - Public key for JWT verification
- `GET /api/health` - Service health check

### GitHub PAT Permissions Required
- `repo` - Full repository access
- `org:read` - Read organization data
- `pull_requests:write` - Create and manage PRs
- `contents:write` - Commit to repositories

### Security Considerations
- Private key stored in GitHub Actions secrets
- JWT tokens with short expiration (15 minutes)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Audit logging for all operations
- Network policies for pod communication

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: < 30 seconds per repository
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Security**: Zero security incidents
- **Adoption**: Support for 100+ repositories per batch
- **Quality**: AI-generated documentation quality score > 85%
